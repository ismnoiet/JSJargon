## How to install it ?
Well, at this moment it is not available at chrome webstore due to some problems with my chrome developer account.
Fortunatuly you can install it manually, just follow the following simple steps :

* Download the [zip file](https://github.com/ismnoiet/JSJargon/archive/v1.0.0.zip) and extract it wherever you want.
* Open a new chrome web page and go to
[chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
* Check the ``developer mode`` checkbox on the top right.
* Click on the ``load unpacked extension`` button and specify the path to the extracted zip file.
* That's it you're done, JUST don't forget to give us a star if you find it useful.

## How it works ?

**If** we click on an already selected item, the item definition
will be hided,
So we get back the nice default list of items without any definition enabled.
 **otherwise** the enabled definition will be removed and
 the definition of the current item will be shown in the
 appropriate place.

This extension also is markdown-based meaning that it reads markdown files, interpret and render them.

## Features

* Fuzzy search( you don't have to type the entire word).
* Markdown support( all definitions are markdown text converted and rendered).
* Syntax highlighting for code snippets.
